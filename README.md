# Hello, I'm Selin! âœ¨

I'm a business data analytics professional who is interested with developing machine learning applications, managing software development projects and becoming an expert in agile project management. 
I have extensive experience in data science and machine learning, with a special focus on large language models. 
Recently, graduated with a Master of Science in Information Systems from Middle East Technical University. 

I'm a cat-mom and enjoying the company of my little daughter Roma while I'm coding in Python and conducting research.

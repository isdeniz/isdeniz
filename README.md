# Hello, I'm Selin! âœ¨

I'm a software developer who is interested with developing enterprise applications, conducting machine learning projects and becoming an expert in agile project management. 
I have extensive experience with Python and I'm familiar with Java, C# and OOP concepts.

I'm a cat-mom and enjoying the company of my little daughter Roma while I'm coding and conducting research.
